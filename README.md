SOME MORE INFO
===================
Bugs:
>>    Cannot look/take shorthand aliases from objects
    I.e. 'take jacket' from a cabinet won't work
         but 'take leather jacket' will work
>>    Shorthand for taking clothing currently doesn't work

Updates:
>>    Survivors require items to save them
      Zombies attack them first.
>>    Inventory carrying is based on strength   
>>    Attacking per second is based on Speed   
>>    Attack, Hit and Barricade animations!   
>>    ASCII maps with multi-map support!   
      Because Iâ€™m a lazy designer..>>    
>>    Levelling Strength/Speed    
      Based on number of Zombie kills   
      5exp per kill, 100exp = level   
>>    Timer based zombies   
      Every 30 seconds zombie movement/attacks will happen   
>>    Respawning zombies and food   
      This allows for continual play   
>>    Hunger system!   
      If you are below 25 health and your hunger is below 30% you slowly gain health   
>>    Zombie "sight"   
      They will go towards you if they are within 2 areas of you   
>>    Barricading areas   
      This allows you to zombie-proof areas (with armour based protection) to slow attacks   
      and make safer areas - Zombies can attack barricades!!   
>>    Clothing and Armour   
      Direct wearing of clothing, some aesthetic and some actually useful   
>>    Weapons and weapon hit randomness   
      Various weapons, some useless others really rather good! All weapons have a detailed   
      accuracy and damage modifiers - small chance of a headshot!   
>>    Save/Load and Delete functions   
      Thank you come again!   
>>    Weight system for inventory   
      This is based on your strength, every strength level you can carry 5 items   
>>    "Look me" basic stats   
      Zombie kills, Food eaten etc   
>>    Support for locked containers and forcing of locks!   
      Allows you to open locked items, but in doing so you will make yourself vunerable   
>>    Automated zombification   
      After you die, you wander the earth

Future Plans:
>>    Farming
>>    Cooking
>>    Infection/disease
>>    Random/user create-able maps
>>    More items/weapons/containers and zombies
